<h1>Fellowship</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a.	Why:</p>

We envision the African continent as a leader in enterprise, technology and innovation and we are willing to make it happen.
</li>
<li>
<p>b.	How:</p>

To achieve this we started the Talent-Bridge fellowship which is a multi-dimensional program geared towards accelerating professional development and giving fellows a seat on the frontline of skills innovation.

The fellowship has 6 practice levels and 2,800+ project hours operating across multiple skill sets with an army of like minded people, all moving in the same direction. 
The program is fully online, semi-synchronous, has strict deadlines, intense project teams, group brainstorming and regular video calls with participants from home, school or their workplace.

This program is not for everyone, its for people who are willing to make their own line instead of towing the line. Unlike most other fellowships or professional development programs we don’t look for top talent instead we create top talent and therefore, our most important criteria is your RESOLVE.

<p>c.	Benefits:</p>
i.	Professional development: We have a comprehensive list of projects across all tracks that will help you develop your technical expertise. We believe that experiential learning is the best way to master your craft.
ii.	Capacity: Our projects push you to the limit and help you stretch beyond your known capacity. You will never know if there is a limit until you are at the limit
iii.	Self-paced: Learn and practise at your own velocity based on your current commitments. Life is a mixed bag and learning never stops
iv.	Develop emotional and cultural competency: The projects expose you to work with different teams, clients and cultures. These are not simulated scenarios but real-life operating ones with lessons that can’t be book taught.
v.	Management and leadership skills: We are not a management or leadership development program but by using best practices around project execution and working in teams you will develop management and leadership skills
vi.	Accelerate your career: You only grow by working on things that are at the next level. You get to pick your career level by working on the projects that take you there.
